Hello and welcome to my "Grandma's Stories" app! I decided to make this in honor of my Great-Grandmother's 100th birthday to be able to keep her century's worth of stories around since we don't know how much time we have left with her.
In my project I am using Tailwind CSS to help with styling, MongoDB for the database, React, express, node, axios, dotenv, moment, cors and mongoose.
