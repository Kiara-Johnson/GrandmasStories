Hello and welcome to my "Grandma's Stories" app! I decided to make this in honor of my Great-Grandmother's 100th birthday to be able to keep her century's worth of stories around since we don't know how much time we have left with her.

In my project I am using Tailwind CSS to help with styling, MongoDB for the database, React, express, node, axios, dotenv, cors and mongoose.

You can find my project plan here: https://trello.com/b/n7Vx1EeV/grandmas-stories 

Some unsolved problems that I have are that I don't have full CRUD functionallity and that my layout is not what I would like it to be.

In the future I would like to have user profiles and authentication.
